I am currently teaching at what best is described as "Junior College", where the highest degree is a bachelor. I have celebrated 25 years as a University Researcher in Computer Science, at Aalborg University, Aarhus University and the IT University of Copenhagen. 

After serving 7 years as Head of Studies at the IT University, stress forced me to reconsider my worklife, and I am now happy as ever teaching again. No more grant proposals, no more papers to push past peer-reviews, just awesome students where I can feel I make a difference on a daily basis.
